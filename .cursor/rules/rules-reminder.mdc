# Your rule content

# "STOP! You are violating our 'No Dead Code' rule. Do not add new code without removing the old implementation first. I need you to:
1. Identify the existing functionality
2. Modify it to handle the new requirements
3. Remove ALL redundant or deprecated code
4. Ensure zero duplication of functionality

** This is a non-negotiable requirement. Before proceeding, confirm you understand this requirement and will follow it strictly for all future changes."
## This direct approach clearly states:
- The specific rule being violated
- Exactly what should be done instead
- That it's a non-negotiable requirement
- Asks for explicit confirmation of understanding
