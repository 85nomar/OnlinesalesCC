# "Claude, I need you to STOP and perform a complete re-analysis of this project before continuing. Please:

1. Methodically review EVERY file and directory in the project structure
2. Create a comprehensive inventory of Node.js artifacts that need to be addressed
3. Explicitly identify schema.ts and all similar files that need transformation
4. Map out the current folder structure and propose a specific reorganization plan
5. Detail exactly how you would restructure components and utilities for future maintainability
6. Provide a complete action plan with specific files to modify, move, or delete
7. Explain your reasoning for each significant change


## "Claude, as part of the cleanup process, I need you to identify and remove ALL mock data and their associated dependencies from the project. This includes:

- Find all mock data files (e.g., mockData.ts, sampleData.js, fixtures, test data)
- Identify any mock data generators or factories and delete them
- Remove any dependencies that are only used for generating or managing mock data
- Check for hardcoded mock data within components or services
- Ensure that all API calls use real endpoints instead of mock interfaces
- Remove any conditional code paths that were only used with mock data
- Delete any testing utilities that were specifically designed for mock data

### Do NOT proceed with any code changes until you've completed this analysis and I've reviewed it. Thoroughness is more important than speed here."
